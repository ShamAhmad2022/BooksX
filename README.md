# Books eXchange:

My first personal project using PHP and phpMyAdmin with HTML, CSS and JS. It was the final project for the "WEB DEVELOPMEN" course i have taken.

BooksX is a simple website where readers can buy, sell or exchange normal/online books with other readers.

I have provided more details in the PowerPoint file, and 7 mintes video on how the website works.
